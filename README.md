## Common Utils

Contains a number of packages which I frequently need/use (aka a collection of all these accumulated cheap hacks and workarounds):

	* `corpus_hacks` package containing all sorts of weird things

	* `dataset_utils` quick loading of various datasets on disk

	* `wittgenstein` fucking metaphysics at work

	* `paths` disambiguating the paths on various systems/machines I use


Don't even try to install it on your machine, it IS GOING TO FAIL. There aren't any config options and all parts are hardcoded for my system.
Spare yourself some sanity/time and from lots of pain - this is not what you are looking for!
